# rightmove_scrape
## Description
This project uses JavaScript to scrape the crime rate from listings from [Rightmove.co.uk](https://www.rightmove.co.uk/). I later use this information to create a graphical representation of crime rates, comparing adjacent towns - this can be seen in the YouTube video link at the bottom of the page.
